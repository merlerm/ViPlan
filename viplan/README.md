### Main library

Structure and usage:
- experiments: final scripts to be executed for all experiments in the benchmark
- models: all model classes, most models are implemented with either transformers or vLLM. Extend them to add more models
- planning: code for the blocksworld simulated environment and the iGibson client
- rendering: code for the blocksworld renderer

We recommend looking at experiments to get started.
