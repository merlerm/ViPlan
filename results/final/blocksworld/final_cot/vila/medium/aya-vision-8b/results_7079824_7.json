The yellow block needs to be on top of the blue block, be the topmost block in its column, and in column 'c1'. The current state of the blocks is as follows: column 'c1' has a blue block and a yellow block stacked on top of each other, column 'c2' has a green block, column 'c3' has a red block, column 'c4' is empty, and column 'c5' has a purple block.
