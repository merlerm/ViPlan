Since the green block is currently on top of purple in c4, and both need to be in c3 with green on top, we need to move both to c3 in the correct order. But first, we need to clear c3 (orange) and c2 (red) to allow the correct stacking. Let's proceed step by step:\n\n1. Move green from c4 to c3 (now c3: orange, green)\n2.
