The red block is currently in column c1, the yellow block in column c2, the orange block in column c3, the blue block in column c4, the green block in column c4, and the purple block in column c4. The red block needs to be moved to column c4, the yellow block needs to be moved to column c2, the orange block needs to be moved to column c1, the blue block needs to be moved to column c4, the green block needs to be moved to column c3, and the purple block needs to be moved to column c4. The red block is already in column c4, so it does not need to be moved. The yellow block is already in column c2, so it does not need to be moved. The orange block is already in column c1, so it does not need to be moved. The blue block is already on top of the red block in column c4, so it does not need to be moved. The green block is already in column c3, so it does not need to be moved. The purple block is already on top of the blue block in column c4, so it does not need to be moved. The only block that needs to be moved is the red block, which is already in the correct position.
