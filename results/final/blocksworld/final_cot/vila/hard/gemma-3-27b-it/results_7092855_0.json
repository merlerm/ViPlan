The goal is to arrange the blocks as follows: purple in c2, blue topmost in c1, orange in c3, green topmost in c4, yellow on top of purple in c2, and red on top of orange in c3. \n\nCurrently, we have: \n- c1: yellow\n- c2: purple, green\n- c3: orange, red\n- c4: blue\n\nPrevious attempts show that moving the purple block to c2 was successful, and the blue block to c1 was also successful. However, moving the yellow block to c2 has consistently failed. This is likely because the yellow block is at the bottom of c1 and can't be moved directly. We need to move the yellow block to the top of c1 first. Then we can move it to c2. Also, the green block needs to be moved to the top of c4. \n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move the yellow block to c4. This will free up c1 for the blue block.\n2. Move the green block to c4. This will put the green block on top of the blue block.\n3. Move the yellow block to c2.
