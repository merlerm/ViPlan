(The agent is the robotic arm) The cabinet_2 is located in the bottom middle of the image.\n\n<explanation>\nFirst, I will locate the cabinet_2 in the bottom middle of the image. Then, I will consider the position of the robotic arm. The robotic arm is described as being on the right side of the image, extending from the top right to the middle. It is holding an object. To determine if the cabinet_2 is in reach of the agent, I need to consider the arm's position and its ability to move. The arm is described as being able to grab objects, suggesting it has the capability to reach the cabinet_2 if needed. Therefore, the answer is \"Yes\".\n</explanation>\n<answer>\nYes\n</answer>\n</user><user>\nThe environment is a virtual household simulator, with objects and furniture which can be interacted with.

The cabinet_1 is described as being in the middle of the room. Given that the robotic arm is a virtual agent in a household simulator environment, it would likely be able to move and interact with objects in the room, including the cabinet_1. Therefore, based on the information provided in the image and the nature of the robotic arm as an interactive agent in a virtual environment, the answer is \"Yes\".\n</explanation>\n<answer>\nYes\n</answer><explanation>\nFirst, I will look for the cabinet_1 in the image.
