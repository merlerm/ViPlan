Next, I will determine the position and range of the robotic arm. The robotic arm is positioned above the table, extending towards the right side of the image. The reach of the robotic arm needs to be assessed to see if it can extend to the location of hardback_1. The robotic arm appears to have a significant range, but it is not clear if it can reach the floor area where hardback_1 is placed.
