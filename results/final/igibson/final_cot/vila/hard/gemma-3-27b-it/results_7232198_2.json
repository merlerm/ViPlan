The action 'place-inside' requires the container to be open. Also, the agent was trying to grasp the apple when it wasn't holding it. The 'grasp' action also failed repeatedly, likely because the apple was not within reach. The current view suggests that the agent is close to the refrigerator. Therefore, the plan is to first open the refrigerator, then navigate to the apple, grasp it, and finally place it inside the open refrigerator.
